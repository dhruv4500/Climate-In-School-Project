<p>Climate is the long-term average of weather, typically averaged over a period of 30 years. <br>
   Some of the meteorological variables that are commonly measured are temperature,<br> 
   humidity,atmospheric pressure, wind, and precipitation.</p>

<p>Climate change describes a change in the average conditions — such as <em>temperature and <br>rainfall</em>
   in a region over <strong>a long period of time</strong>. NASA scientists have observed Earth’s surface is <br><u>warming</u>,
   and many of the warmest years on record have happened in the past 20 years.</p>

  <h2>Brief on the Topic</h2>
<p>Change in climate has consequences on the biophysical environment such as changes in <br>
   the start and length of the seasons, glacial retreat, decrease in Arctic sea ice extent and a <br>
   rise in sea level. These changes have already had an observable impact on biodiversity at <br>
   the species level, in term of distribution & populations, and ecosystem level in terms of distribution, composition & function.</p>

<p>Many changes have been reported in the distribution of species. In general, many species have expanded <br>
  their ranges poleward in latitude and upward in elevation. Evidence of contraction in species’ distribution<br>
  is limited, however, possibly due to reporting difficulties and time lag in such contractions due to a wide<br>
  variety of possible mechanism such as population dynamics. Populations of many species have declined, and<br>
  although in some cases climate change is believed to have contributed to the decline, attributing this is <br>
  fraught with difficulty as it is likely to be only one driver amongst many. At the species level, changes <br>
  observed that can be attributed to climate change involve those surrounding phenology (the timing of events).<br>
  Many birds and insects are showing changes, such as earlier onset of migration, egg-laying and breeding.  In<br>
  terms of ecosystems, there has been some evidence on changes in distribution. e.g. desert ecosystems have <br>
  expanded, and tree lines in mountain systems have changed. Changes in the composition of ecosystems have also <br>
  been observed (e.g. increased lianas in tropical forest). Such changes may affect ecosystem function and the<br>
  ecosystem services they provide. Changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services due to climate change are not<br>
  all negative, with some species either thriving or adapting.</p>

<p>Changes to ecosystems as a result of climate change are likely to have significant and often negative social,<br>
   cultural and economic consequences. However, there is still uncertainty about the extent and speed at which <br>
   climate change will impact biodiversity and ecosystem services, and the thresholds of climate change above<br>
   which ecosystems are irreversibly changed and no longer function in their current form. Tipping points are<br>
   points at which a system passes from one steady state to another. These are used for either climate tipping <br>
   points or ecosystem tipping points.</p>
